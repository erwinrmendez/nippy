# nippy: Chrome app for notes and code snippets

**nippy** allows you to create and save notes in your browser, like those links you think you might use later or that piece of code you found particularly interesting.

This is one project in a series of tools that I am building, whether for daily use or just for the fun of learning something new.

## Features

- Changes saved to Local Storage automatically.
- Rich text enabled, using [draft-js](https://draftjs.org/) editor.
- Draggable tabs with [react-beatiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd).

Try a demo of the app [here](https://nippy-chrome-app.web.app/).

## Let's chat!

I love learning new stuff, so any comments or suggestions are most welcomed.

Also, I love coffee. If you are around, we might try to do one those virtual coffee hangouts (it's totally a thing). Just hit me up!
